What interests you? What are your passions? 
Think at least three questions about topics you would be willing to study for your semester project. 
Create a section in your report for each question.
Try to think of concrete "data questions" rather than abstract questions. 
"How do earnings of movie sequels compare to the original?" is easier to answer than "Is watching movies fun?"
[ ] In each section:
[ ] Write a short explanation of why this question interests you.
[ ] Get feedback from at least two people on your question. 
Is it interesting? Does it make sense? Is it possible to answer in a semester? 
Summarize the feedback in your report. 
(You can use the same two people for each question.)
[ ] Do some research. Can you find examples of other people using data to answer this question? 
Summarize your research, and include links to any articles/papers/blog posts you found.
[ ] Do a preliminary search for data. 
Can you find the data you would need to answer your question? 
If you not, can you find data that is at least on the same topic? 
Is it free? Easy to download? 
Comes in a single file or multiple files? 
Again, summarize your research and provide links to any data sources you find.




###HOW TO DETECT FAKE NEWS?
We are surrounded by fake news in the world we are living today, 
to distinguish fake news or facts is primary for our living.
It affects what our belief and actions. 
I would like to work on a project about fake news detection. 
Not only it could be interesting, but also very helpful to myself. 
I wish to know the truth and facts about this world, 
instead of stories that people make up fot views and subscriptions. 
Even in the world like today, many people do not believe the existence of 
fake news. They think it is just a over-worried idea that people are discussing. 
With a media that they rely on, they simply do not believe theere are
false and misleading information from the media that they are familiar with. 
If I could work on detecting false news, I would like to find out the percentage 
of false news from the mainstream media. Comparing them between each other, 
and the content of their fasle news. And I wonder

###US STOCK PREDICTION
I am always interested in learning about the stock market and how it runs.
I have some experience with it, but I would like to deepen my knowledge 
with doing a data analysis project on it. 
Th concern is that the US stock market includes numerous of stocks and would I 
be able to predict all of them with the analysis I make. And would I focus on 
certain industries instead. 
And, would be I understand the resources that I found and evaluate them well.
